calculate_BOLD_optimals_cluster.py script should iterate over matrices in the data/derived/Omats_FCs/all_Omats.npz and compare each matrix against the corresponding sweep csv in data/derived/sweeps/sweep_G_target_*-opti_SC_extend, according to their diagnosis (MCI goes with AD)

It should return the global coupling and target parameters per individual, that is needed for the local target optimization later
